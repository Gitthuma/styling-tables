Styling our table

Let's work through styling our table example together.

1. To start with, make a local copy of the sample markup, download both images (noise and leopardskin), and put the three resulting files in a working directory somewhere on your local computer.
2. Next, create a new file called style.css and save it in the same directory as your other files.
3. Link the CSS to the HTML by placing the following line of HTML inside your &lt;head&gt;:

&lt;link href="style.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"&gt;
